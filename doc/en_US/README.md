## Introduction

This is a linear algebra library written in [**MoonBit**](https://www.moonbitlang.cn/), designed to fill the gap in the MoonBit ecosystem for scientific computing.

The project will offer high-performance implementations of foundational linear algebra methods, based on one-dimensional arrays, supporting both numerical and symbolic computation.

**_Starting from the first official release, both English and Chinese documentation will be fully maintained. Japanese documentation may be added in future updates._**

## Feature List

**[Latest]** 25.01.29: Mutable Matrix implementation

- **25.01.29**: Mutable Vector implementation
